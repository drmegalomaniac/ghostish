*Ghostish is Jekyll theme designed to ease migration from [Ghost](https://ghost.org)*. Using the output from [jekyll_ghost_importer](https://github.com/eloyesp/jekyll_ghost_importer) and this theme, migrating to Jekyll should be a breeze.

Uses /content/ instead of the Jekyll standard /assets/ for images. That way you can just copy across the folder from your Ghost installation and don't need to edit all the Post's Front Matter sections, as generated by [jekyll_ghost_importer](https://github.com/eloyesp/jekyll_ghost_importer).
